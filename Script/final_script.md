# YouTube Script: "I Ate Like a Busy CEO for 30 Days - Here's What Happened"

## Hook (0-20 seconds)
*[Energetic, direct eye contact]*

What if I told you that eating like a billionaire CEO doesn't mean expensive meals... but actually eating SMARTER? For 30 days, I followed the exact nutrition strategy used by some of the world's busiest executives. And honestly? The results shocked me more than you'd think.

*[Pause for effect]*

But here's the crazy part – it took me LESS time than my old eating habits, not more.

## Introduction (20-60 seconds)
*[Relatable, conversational tone]*

Look, I get it. You're crushing it at work, building your future, maybe juggling school and side hustles. But somewhere between that 7 AM meeting and your 9 PM deadline, you realize you've survived on coffee, a granola bar, and pure willpower.

Sound familiar?

*[Slight pause]*

The problem isn't that you don't WANT to eat well – it's that you literally don't have time to figure out what that even means. Meanwhile, your energy crashes at 3 PM, your brain feels foggy during important presentations, and you're basically running on empty.

But here's what I discovered: the busiest people in the world – we're talking Fortune 500 CEOs managing billion-dollar companies – they've cracked the code on getting maximum nutrition with minimal effort.

## The Challenge Setup (60-90 seconds)
*[Engaged, storytelling mode]*

So I decided to test it. For 30 days, I would eat exactly like a busy CEO. No meal prep Sundays. No complicated recipes. Just strategic nutrition that fits into an insane schedule.

The rules were simple: Every meal had to take less than 10 minutes to prepare OR be something I could grab on the go. And it had to hit seven essential nutrients that most busy people are missing.

*[Slight pause for transition]*

Before I share what happened, let me break down these seven nutrients that literally changed how I felt every single day.

## The 7 Essential Nutrients

### 1. Protein (90-150 seconds)
*[Clear, educational tone]*

First up: **Protein**. And I don't just mean for muscle building. Your brain literally runs on amino acids from protein. When you skip it, that afternoon brain fog? That's your neurons running on fumes.

The busy person hack? Greek yogurt with nuts for breakfast – 20 grams of protein in 2 minutes. Or my personal favorite: protein powder in your coffee. Boom. You've just turned your caffeine addiction into a nutritional power move.

*[Pause]*

CEOs swear by this because it keeps their energy stable for hours, not just 30 minutes like that pastry you grabbed.

### 2. Fiber (150-210 seconds)
*[Conversational, relatable]*

Next: **Fiber**. This is the nutrient that keeps everything... running smoothly, if you know what I mean. But here's what most people don't know – fiber actually controls your energy levels throughout the day.

When you eat fiber, it slows down sugar absorption, which means no more energy rollercoaster. No more 3 PM crash that has you reaching for your third coffee.

Quick wins? Apples with peanut butter. Berries in that Greek yogurt I mentioned. Or literally just throw some chia seeds into whatever you're already eating. One tablespoon gives you 5 grams of fiber – that's more than most people get all day.

### 3. Omega-3 Fatty Acids (210-270 seconds)
*[Slightly more serious, health-focused]*

Number three: **Omega-3s**. Your brain is 60% fat, and if you're not feeding it the right kind, you're literally underperforming mentally.

Omega-3s improve focus, memory, and even mood. I noticed this one by week two – presentations felt easier, I was sharper in meetings, less irritable after long days.

The CEO move? Canned salmon on whole grain crackers. Takes 3 minutes, tastes great, and gives you a week's worth of omega-3s in one snack. Or if you hate fish like I used to, high-quality fish oil supplements work too.

### 4. Iron (270-330 seconds)
*[Energetic, explaining personal experience]*

**Iron** – and this one surprised me. I always thought iron deficiency was just about being tired. But it's actually about brain power too.

Low iron means less oxygen to your brain. And when your brain doesn't get enough oxygen, decision-making gets harder, creativity drops, and everything just feels... harder.

Quick sources? Dark leafy greens, but let's be real – when's the last time you had time for a proper salad? Instead: fortified cereals for breakfast, or dried fruit and nuts as snacks. Even dark chocolate counts!

### 5. Magnesium (330-390 seconds)
*[Calm, explaining the stress connection]*

**Magnesium** is basically nature's chill pill. It helps with stress, sleep, and muscle function. And when you're pulling 12-hour days, your magnesium gets depleted FAST.

This was a game-changer for my sleep quality. Even on stressful days, I was falling asleep easier and waking up more refreshed.

The busy hack? Nuts and seeds. Almonds, pumpkin seeds, even dark chocolate again. Or magnesium powder in your evening drink – 30 seconds to better sleep.

### 6. Vitamin D (390-450 seconds)
*[Relatable, addressing common deficiency]*

**Vitamin D** – the sunshine vitamin that most of us aren't getting enough of, especially if you're spending all day indoors crushing deadlines.

Low vitamin D affects everything: energy, immune system, even mood. I actually started taking my calls outside when possible and added a simple vitamin D3 supplement.

Food sources are tricky, so supplementation is usually your best bet here. But fatty fish, fortified milk, and egg yolks help too.

### 7. B-Complex Vitamins (450-510 seconds)
*[Energetic, wrapping up the nutrients]*

Finally: **B vitamins**. These are your energy production vitamins. Without them, you're like a car trying to run without spark plugs.

The beautiful thing? They're everywhere if you know where to look. Whole grains, eggs, leafy greens. That avocado toast you love? Add an egg on top and you've got B vitamins covered.

## The Results (510-630 seconds)
*[Excited, sharing personal transformation]*

So what happened after 30 days of eating like this?

*[Pause]*

Week one: I stopped crashing at 3 PM. Like, completely stopped. My energy was steady from morning to night.

Week two: My focus during long meetings improved dramatically. I could actually think clearly even at the end of 10-hour days.

Week three: People started asking if I was getting more sleep. My skin looked better, I felt more positive, and honestly, I was just... happier.

*[Pause for emphasis]*

But here's the real kicker – I was spending LESS time thinking about food, not more. When you know exactly what nutrients you need, decision fatigue disappears.

## Practical Implementation (630-750 seconds)
*[Practical, actionable tone]*

Now, you're probably thinking, "This sounds great, but HOW do I actually do this with my crazy schedule?"

Here's my simple framework:

**Breakfast**: Greek yogurt with berries and nuts. Covers protein, fiber, and healthy fats. 3 minutes max.

**Lunch**: If you're ordering out, choose salmon or chicken with vegetables. If you're meal prepping, hard-boiled eggs with whole grain crackers and an apple.

**Dinner**: Even takeout can work – just add a side salad and choose grilled over fried.

**Snacks**: Mixed nuts, fruit, or that protein coffee I mentioned.

And here's the secret sauce – **supplements fill the gaps**. A good multivitamin, omega-3, and vitamin D cover your bases when food isn't perfect.

*[Pause]*

The goal isn't perfection. It's progress.

## Reality Check (750-840 seconds)
*[Honest, authentic]*

Look, I'm not going to lie to you. There were days when I still ended up eating whatever was closest. That's real life.

But here's what changed: even on my worst nutrition days, I knew exactly what my body was missing. So instead of beating myself up, I'd just focus on hitting those nutrients the next day.

*[Pause]*

This isn't about becoming a nutrition perfectionist. It's about making choices that actually support your goals instead of working against them.
